# ts-lib-boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate for a Typescript project meant to be used as a starting point for my library projects.

It's based on the setup described in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRmLTZyq57U) video.

## Todo

- Add dist/package.json for distribution on NPM.
- Setup support for library import from GH.
- Setup testing support in the boilerplate.
